# Restore the working version

Restore the previous working single-file version of the plugin from kiindulo.txt or kiindulasi2.txt to src/main.cpp.

Ask the user which version they prefer, then:
1. Backup the current modular version
2. Copy the selected working version to src/main.cpp
3. Update the project files if needed
